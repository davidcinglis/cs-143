By David Inglis, Bolton Bailey, Jagriti Agrawal, Nikita Sirohi

This is a networking simulator for Caltech's CS143 course. It models the transmission
of data through a variety of flows through a network of hosts and routers. It
supports two TCP congestion control algorithms: TCP Reno and FAST-TCP.

Usage: `python main.py test_case congestion_control`

Supported congestion control algorithms: `reno` and `fast`

Supported test cases: `0` and `1` and `2`
